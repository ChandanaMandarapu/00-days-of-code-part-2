Hello Everyone,

Pomodoro Timer

This code implements a simple Pomodoro Timer web application. A method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. T

The web page displays a timer with a default time of 25 minutes. It consists of a container, a timer display, and three buttons: "Start," "Pause," and "Reset." The timer container is centered on the page and has a white background with a slight shadow effect. The timer display shows the remaining time in minutes and seconds.

The functionality of the timer is as follows

Start: When the "Start" button is clicked, the timer begins counting down from 25 minutes. The timer is displayed in the format of minutes and seconds. The countdown updates every second, and the timer automatically stops when it reaches zero, triggering an alert to notify the user that the time is up.

Pause: Clicking the "Pause" button stops the countdown. The timer can be resumed by clicking the "Start" button again.
Reset: The "Reset" button sets the timer back to its initial state of 25 minutes and 00 seconds. It also stops the countdown if it is currently running.

The HTML code provides the structure and styling for the web page, while the JavaScript code handles the timer functionality. The JavaScript code uses DOM manipulation to access the necessary elements in the HTML and add event listeners to the buttons. It also utilizes a setInterval function to update the timer display every second and control the countdown.

To use the Pomodoro Timer, simply open the HTML file in a web browser and interact with the buttons as desired. Start the timer to begin a 25-minute work session, pause it when needed, and reset it to the initial state for a new session.

This implementation of the Pomodoro Timer is a basic version that can be further customized and enhanced based on specific requirements.
