        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Hey, I'm Chandana. Today marks one year since I dropped out of college due to financial issues. It has been a journey of ups and downs, but coding has always been my passion. I started with C and explored other languages like C++, Java. Along the way, I faced challenges and felt demotivated, but then I discovered web development. I dived into front-end development, worked on exciting projects, and now I'm taking up this 100-day coding challenge to push my limits. I know I'm giving only a fraction of my true potential, but I'm determined to improve. In this journey, there will be critics and supporters, but what truly matters is my skills and growth.

          <h2>Challenges and Learning</h2>
          <p>
            During these 60 days, I have learned a lot and improved my coding skills. One important lesson I've learned is that rushing doesn't lead to success; it takes time to become really good at something. I received support and appreciation for my projects, although some people also discouraged me. Focusing on the positive aspects of this journey keeps me motivated. Sometimes, I doubt myself and feel demotivated, but I believe I can achieve even more in the future. I am determined to give my best and work harder than ever before. Best is yet to come this is only 2% of Chandana...
