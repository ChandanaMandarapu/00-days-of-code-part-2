Hello Everyone,

Drawing App
This code represents a simple web-based drawing application. When the HTML file is opened in a web browser, it displays a blank canvas where users can draw lines by clicking and dragging the mouse cursor.

How It Works..

The code uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the drawing app.

The HTML part defines the structure of the web page. It sets up a canvas, which is like a digital drawing board. The CSS part defines the appearance of the canvas and the background color of the page.

The JavaScript part adds functionality to the drawing app. When you open the web page, the canvas is set to fill the entire browser window.The website keeps track of whether you're currently drawing and remembers the position of your mouse according to your mouse movement.

When you press the mouse button on the canvas, the drawing starts. The website remembers where you started drawing. As you move the mouse, the app draws lines on the canvas. 

It uses the last position and the current position of your mouse to create the lines.
When you release the mouse button, the drawing stops.

Functionality..

The canvas element is defined with the id "canvas". This is where the drawing will take place.
The JavaScript part of the code starts by obtaining references to the canvas element and its 2D rendering context.

(WHAT IS 2D rendering context) ???

In the code, the term "2D rendering context" refers to the built-in functionality of the HTML canvas element that allows you to draw and manipulate 2D graphics. It provides a set of JavaScript functions and properties specifically designed for creating and controlling visual elements, such as lines, shapes, and text, on the canvas. By obtaining the 2D rendering context, the code is able to utilize these drawing capabilities to create and modify the visual content displayed on the canvas area of the web page.

The canvas size is set to match the dimensions of the browser window, ensuring the drawing area fills the entire screen. Several variables are declared to keep track of the drawing state, including whether the user is currently drawing, and the coordinates of the last drawn point.

The startDrawing function is triggered when the user presses the mouse button down on the canvas. It sets the isDrawing flag to true and records the initial position of the mouse cursor.
The draw function is called when the user moves the mouse while holding down the mouse button. It checks if drawing is currently in progress and, if so, starts a new path on the canvas with the specified styling properties (color, line width, and line cap). It then draws a line from the last recorded position to the current mouse position. The last position is updated to the current position.

The stopDrawing function is called when the user releases the mouse button. It sets the isDrawing flag to false, indicating that drawing has stopped.
The code adds event listeners to the canvas element to capture mouse events. When the mouse button is pressed, it calls startDrawing, when the mouse is moved, it calls draw, and when the mouse button is released, it calls stopDrawing.
